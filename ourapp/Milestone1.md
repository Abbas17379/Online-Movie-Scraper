# Milestone 1

# Any changes to the original proposal. 

No changes to the orginal proposal so far.

# Outline the three main goals of your application––these can change throughout the semester but note that these are the criteria that will drive the motivation of your project.

    1. Website would pool in links via scraping other clone sites 
    2. Should provide a status indicator of which links are working or not
    3. Enhance user experience as compared to the typical pirated site (No pop-up Ads, User Specific Recommendations, More professional user interface as compared to other pirated sites- something closer to Netflix than to FMovies aesthetically at least)

# A list of all tasks to be completed before the final due date.

The answer to this may vary greatly as the website develops but so far I have the following:

    1. Research and understand web scraping
    2. Identify target sites for scraping (pirated sites)
    3. Choose a technology stack for scraping the back end (Node.js or Python maybe)
    4. Conceptualise flow of data between the scraping, data-base, and the backend (maybe I'm missing something here)
    5. Set up  a database like My SQL or MongoDB (my sister told me these)
    6. Set up the UI (Movie/Show listings, Status Indicators, Recommendation System, REMINDER SYSTEM FOR ASSINGMENTS  *VERY IMPORTANT*)
    7. Block pop up ads.
    8. Maybe set up user accounts
