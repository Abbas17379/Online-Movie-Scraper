# Project Name: Pirated Movie Scraper
# By Mohammad Abbas Naqvi

# What is the web application concept?

The concept of the application stems from the widespread existence of pirated streaming sites and how their functionality is unreliable. This is obviously due to the sites being taken down periodically due to their illegality (who would've thought not paying for a movie was illegal ðŸ‘€). Regardless, from my personal experience of using these websites it proves to be a headache when I got to try and watching one of the many shows on my binge list and the site's links failed entirely.

That would prompt an excursion to go and find one of the many fbox/fmovies clone sites that hadn't at that time been taken down or were working at least which would be a hassle in and of itself.

What I was considering to be an idea for my web applciation, then, was that I make a localised space (i.e my own website) and pool in all the links from these clone sites to make in essence a sort of mega fmovies site with some other utilities added to it givng it a more bougie Netflix esque vibe rather than a "constant ad-pop up" and "I might get a virus any second" vibe.

# What are the objectives of the application?

My goals for this site as of right now are pretty raw. For now I do know the bare minimums I want which include:

    1. Pooling in links from various sites
    2. Preventing pop ups
    3. Status indicators of whether or not links are functional
    4. Recommendations based off watched movies/shows
    5. POP UP REMINDERS TO STOP WATCHING AND DO ASSIGNMENTS

I will probably add more or take out some of these as the design process gets under way as there might be hiccups along the way or I might find inspiration to add more features.

# Any preliminary design considerations?

I was expecting my website to function as a sort of scraper. That is honestly what the functionality of my webiste hinges on. Once the scraping aspect is implemented I believe (perhaps naively as of right now) that the rest of the process shouldn't be as painstaking as it should be the equivalent of making my own FMovies/Fbox site albeit with some more features.

# Are there any challenges that your group anticipates?

Other than the fact I don't know where to start as well as not knowing how to make a scraper, I am perfectly confident in my ability ðŸ˜€. In all seriousness though, once I get a know how about how scrapers function, I hope the website building aspect shouldn't be as difficult as there are countless examples out there. These pirated sites themselves also have aesthetic layouts which I hope to take insipration from.
