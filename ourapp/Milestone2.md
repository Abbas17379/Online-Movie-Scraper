# Milestone 2

Requirement 1, which is the backend is mostly untouched for now. I am currently looking into APIs to assist me in the scraping process. Once I have an idea about how to implement scraping into the web-app I'll do so. Other than that the login is also left over for now. 

When I implelemnt the scraper, I have a general idea of how to proceed as I will make a database for the scraped links.

Requirements 4, 5, and 6 are "done" but can obviously be worked on more.

So most of the work right now has been done on the react end. Will catch up the rails end of the site (backend) over fall break as time is tight right now which is why I decided to focus on the aesthetics and design of the site for now.

Will implement features required by milestone 3 by next week (i.e the Json, backend API endpoints).
