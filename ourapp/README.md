# Project Name: Pirated Movie Scraper

## Introduction
Basically what I was thinking was that we can make a Netflix where we can localize all the pirated websites, making status pages to monitor which ones of them are functioning since they get taken down often. Moreover, we can add other utility tools that show your last watched show, keep track of watch history, etc across the various pirated sites on our own page. 


I know it's very raw as of right now but has some utility (whoever doesn't like paying for subscription-based streaming services).
