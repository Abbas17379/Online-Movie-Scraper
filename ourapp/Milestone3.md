# Milestone 3

Requirement 1, is mostly on track. A static (non-scraper) version of the site is up and running at this point. Now the main thing left to implement is the actual scarper itself. I have gotten opinions on this from the Co-Lab staff and they've told me that rails has a built in scraper functionallity via Nokogiri which I will look into.

As for the database, I have set it up and it holds, Movie names, their links, and their statuses. It is static for now but will hopefully be dynamic once the scraper has been implemented.

I have discussed with Alex, there won't be any point in implementing a user sign in a standardized content interaction based website.

Requirements 4, 5, and 6 are "done" but can obviously be worked on more. I will worry more about the design aspects once I have made headway on the scraper.

# To Do

1) Figure out how Nokogiri works and how to use it to scrape links
2) Figure out how to alter database given the scraped links
3) Figure out how to actually implement the status indicators from theoretical to actual code.
