# Milestone 5

I figured out the scraper WOOOOOO!!! Now all I need to do is set up the dynamic updating of the website database, and get it on a duke domain/Vm because I had to leave class early that day.

Moreover, my app meets all almost all of the 7 requirements. All I need to do now is get it up and running on a public webpage which  I will do during office hours.

I met all my Milestone1 requirements surprisingly. I was able to get the scraper to work, which was the hardest one so that is reassuring. I didn't implement the sign in like you said after we discussed. All that said, I am excited to meet you after break to get this up and running.

Make sure to watch the zoom link to watch how I got the scraper to work. (IT TOOK HOURS)
