# Game Version of Stanford Smallville

## What is Stanford Smallville?

An elaborate summary to the Stanford Smallville project on Medium: https://rikiphukon.medium.com/stanford-smallville-is-officially-open-source-9882e3fbc981

Stanford Smallville is a project done to experiment on the ability of AI agents to generate realistic behaviors in series, and to lead interactions with each other. 

Specifically, the project team created a virtual village where all NPCs/villagers are guided by AI. They are able to act within their identities/roles, interact with the village's environment (such as schools, groceries, all kinds of workplaces) and other villagers, memorize and reflect what they've done and what's happened, and make decisions and plans accordingly. It turns out that certain somewhat creative and unexpected chemistry is seen among the villagers.

## What kind of game is it?

I hope to turn it into a game (single-player or multi-player) where the potential of AI npc could be extensively explored. It could be something like Sims (where players live an actual life in the game, get married, buy a house etc.) or Sims City (where players are mayor to their own city, basically just Sims but player has a special role, access and goal). 

## Tools & method

Either just use Openai API or fine tone a model on Hugging Face. Stanford Smallville also has open source git hub.
